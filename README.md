# Pretense Zone Tools

This repository contains two standalone HTML tools for working with DCS Pretense missions:

## üîß 1. `zonecreator.html` ‚Äî Zone Definition Generator

A browser-based GUI for building `ZoneCommand` Lua snippets with the following features:

- Upload an `init.lua` file to auto-load available presets
- Create new zones with:
    - Custom names
    - Initial side (Red/Blue)
    - Optional spawn and base settings
- Add upgrade levels and product presets under each zone
- Auto-generate structured Lua code with syntax highlighting
- Support for optional mission fields (`altitude`, `range`, `freq`, `tacan`, `variant`, `expend`) when a preset contains `.missions.`
- Copy and toggle raw/highlighted output
- Works entirely in-browser ‚Äî no internet connection required after loading

## üîó 2. `zone_connection.html` ‚Äî Zone Connection Tool

A lightweight companion tool that:

- Parses zone names from the same `init.lua`
- Lets you create `cm:addConnection(...)` Lua statements between zones
- Supports optional "true state" with resource values
- Outputs the Lua connection logic for pasting into your mission

## üìÇ How to Use

1. Open either `zonecreator.html` or `zone_connection.html` in your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)
2. Upload your `init.lua` file when prompted
    - This file can be found inside the `.miz` file of a Pretense mission:
        - Change the `.miz` file extension to `.zip`
        - Extract it and locate `init.lua` under the `mission` or `scripts` folder
3. Use the UI to configure zones or define zone connections
4. Copy and paste the generated Lua code into your mission's Lua files
